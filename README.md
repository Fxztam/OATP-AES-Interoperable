# OATP-AES-Interoperable
Interoperability between Oracle ATP AES256-CBC and others

## Motivation

The interoperability between modern software systems is particularly important for customers. 
Thanks to the Oracle RESTful Data Service - ORDS - technology in my Always Free Oracle Autonomous Transactional Processing Database, I can also test the dedicated point-to-point encryption of data items, i.e. from the respective front-end item to the ATP  DB back-end item.

A first prerequisite for this is the verification of the interoperability of the data encryption used between the OracleATP AES256 and other systems.
