# OATP-AES-Interoperable
Interoperability between Oracle Autonomous Transactional Processing Database (Oracle ATP) AES256-CBC and others

## Motivation

The interoperability between modern software systems is particularly important for customers. 
Thanks to the Oracle RESTful Data Service - ORDS - technology in my Always Free Oracle ATP, I can also test the dedicated point-to-point encryption of data items, i.e. from the respective front-end item to the ATP DB back-end item.

A first prerequisite for this is the verification of the interoperability of the data encryption used between the OracleATP AES256-CBC and other systems:

- Web Browser Crytography API AES256-CBC
- GOlang AES256-CBC
- Java AES256-CBC
- Python AES256-CBC .
